# Online-Retail-Recommendation-System

The following code script opens in Jupyter Notebook.

Introduction:
In today's competitive e-commerce environment, personalized shopping experiences are key to customer satisfaction and increased sales. This project focuses on developing an Online Retail Product Recommendation System using Python, designed to suggest relevant products to customers based on their purchase history and preferences.

By analyzing historical Amazon sales data, the system uses techniques like collaborative filtering to predict items that customers are likely to buy. Python's powerful libraries, including Pandas, Scikit-surprise, Matplotlib and Seaborn, are utilized to build, train, and evaluate the recommendation model. The goal is to create a scalable and efficient recommendation engine that can enhance user experience and boost conversion rates for online retailers.
